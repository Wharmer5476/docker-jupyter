# ptimof/jupyter-pyql

Base + PyQL [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org) Docker image. See [GitHub repo](https://github.com/ptimof/docker-jupyter)
for usage instructions.

This is an installation of [PyQL](https://github.com/enthought/pyql) on top of the `ptimof/jupyter-base`
image.

*Note*: [QuantLib](http://quantlib.org) will take significant time to build. It may be best
to pull [ptimof/jupyter-pyql](https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/ptimof/jupyter-pyql/) from Docker,
rather than build from this `Dockerfile`.
